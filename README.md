# dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles I normally use to have a standard bash environment on some new machines when I need to first use them. Its main purpose is to install a few resources and allow for consistant aliases, environment variables and tools which can be installed for all *nix based systems. 

You can shoot me a fork if you want to improve anything you used / saw. 

### Warning: 

Sorry, I don't really test this on all systems it claims to support. I do my best. 

    Run at own risk lol
